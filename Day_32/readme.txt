In the next lesson, I'll show you how to send email using the smtplib module and Python. If you are getting the error Connection unexpectedly closed, it might be due to a number of things. You can come back to this lesson to debug.


1. Make sure you've got the correct smtp address for your email provider:

Gmail: smtp.gmail.com

Hotmail: smtp.live.com

Outlook: outlook.office365.com

Yahoo: smtp.mail.yahoo.com

If you use another email provider, just Google for your email provider e.g. "Gmail SMTP address"


Below are steps specific to users sending email from Gmail addresses.

2. Make sure you've enabled less secure apps if you are sending from a Gmail account. (Refer to the video in the next lesson for steps).

3. Try to go through the Gmail Captcha here while logged in to the Gmail account: https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha

4. Add a port number by changing your code to this:

smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", port=587)

# 1. Update the birthdays.csv with your friends & family's details.
# HINT: Make sure one of the entries matches today's date for testing purposes. e.g.
#name,email,year,month,day
#YourName,your_own@email.com,today_year,today_month,today_day

# 2. Check if today matches a birthday in the birthdays.csv
# HINT 1: Create a tuple from today's month and day using datetime. e.g.
# today = (today_month, today_day)

# HINT 2: Use pandas to read the birthdays.csv

# HINT 3: Use dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary from birthday.csv that is formated like this:
# birthdays_dict = {
#     (birthday_month, birthday_day): data_row
# }
#Dictionary comprehension template for pandas DataFrame looks like this:
# new_dict = {new_key: new_value for (index, data_row) in data.iterrows()}
#e.g. if the birthdays.csv looked like this:
# name,email,year,month,day
# Angela,angela@email.com,1995,12,24
#Then the birthdays_dict should look like this:
# birthdays_dict = {
#     (12, 24): Angela,angela@email.com,1995,12,24
# }

#HINT 4: Then you could compare and see if today's month/day tuple matches one of the keys in birthday_dict like this:
# if (today_month, today_day) in birthdays_dict:

# 3. If there is a match, pick a random letter (letter_1.txt/letter_2.txt/letter_3.txt) from letter_templates and replace the [NAME] with the person's actual name from birthdays.csv
# HINT 1: Think about the relative file path to open each letter.
# HINT 2: Use the random module to get a number between 1-3 to pick a randome letter.
# HINT 3: Use the replace() method to replace [NAME] with the actual name. https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_replace.asp

# 4. Send the letter generated in step 3 to that person's email address.
# HINT 1: Gmail(smtp.gmail.com), Yahoo(smtp.mail.yahoo.com), Hotmail(smtp.live.com), Outlook(smtp-mail.outlook.com)
# HINT 2: Remember to call .starttls()
# HINT 3: Remember to login to your email service with email/password. Make sure your security setting is set to allow less secure apps.
# HINT 4: The message should have the Subject: Happy Birthday then after \n\n The Message Body.
